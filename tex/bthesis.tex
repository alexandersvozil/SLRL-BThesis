\title{Bachelor Thesis \\ The Server Location Problem with Restricted Loads 
on Servers and Links}

\maketitle

\section{Abstract}
The server location problem with restricted loads on servers and links (SLRL) is an NP-Complete
problem, introduced by Hiroyoshi Miwa et al. in the Paper "Method of Locating Mirror Servers
to Alleviate Load on Servers and Links" \cite{mirrorserver}. The problem 
came up, because the massive volume of data distributed by content delivery networks (CDNs) 
require well located mirror servers in order not to badly influence the quality of their service.
Two examples for CDNs would be "Amazon CloudFront" a traditional commercial CDN, or the "AT\&T Inc."
a Telco CDN which has advantages over traditional CDNs because they own the so called "last mile",
the final leg of the telecommunications networks. CDN nodes are usually deployed in multiple 
locations, often over multiple backbones, reaching thousands of nodes with tens of thousands of 
servers. \cite{wiki:cdn} \cite{wiki:lastmile}
The two constraints induced by the choice of mirror servers is the number of maximum nodes
accessing a mirror server and maximum number of nodes accessing a mirror server 
through a specific link. The constraint mentioned first, corresponds to the network load on
the (mirror-)servers. The second constraint corresponds to the restricted load on the links.
First I want to prove that SLRL is NP-complete. Next, I want to propose my own algorithm as a
sequel to the existing greedy algorithm proposed by Miwa et al. \cite{mirrorserver}.

\section{Introduction}
    \subsection {CDNs}
        "A content delivery network is a collaborative collection of network elements spanning
        the Internet, where content is replicated over several mirrored Web servers in order
        to perform transparent and effective delivery of content to the end user."\cite[p. 3]{Buyya:2008:CDN:1457653}
        To perform efficient delivery of data, CDNs need to have several mirrored Web servers
        and thus it is important to place them well, because placing the mirror server 
        could be an expensive choice considering no prior calculation where it should go. 
        The expensive choice manifests in high link usages and or a maximal neighbourhood being
        too big for the server to handle.
        The mirror servers naturally serve the same data, as they are there to alleviate the 
        load of the other servers providing the data.
